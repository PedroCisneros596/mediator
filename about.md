Welcome to our project exploring the dynamic landscape of the European Airbnb market. We have focused on eight European cities: Athens, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, London, Paris, Prague and Vienna. All of them are popular destinations and though they offer different kinds of tourism and have different attitudes regarding Airbnb regulations, they all experience the pros and cons of modern tourism and the Airbnb European market. Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover trends, challenges, and insights shaping short-term Airbnb rentals across Europe. This site showcases our findings, combining rigorous research with interactive visuals to provide a clear understanding of how Airbnb impacts cities and their local communities. Whether youâ€™re a traveler, policymaker, or curious data enthusiast, we hope you find this exploration both informative and inspiring.
