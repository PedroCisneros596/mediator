># Life is hard already, let's not make it harder for each other.


Hi! I'm Cole, a Senior Engineering Manager at Zendesk! I spent almost a decade as a hands on engineer at a few different companies until I started managing in 2017. I kept my hands on the keyboard until
my teams grew too big for me to responsibly be in their critical path as a coder (and maybe a little past that point... oops!).

I get really nerdy about engineering management and read about it broadly. I have a 3 year masters in Transformative Leadership and
Social Change from the Maryland University of Integrative Health and have taken part in several executive and leadership coaching programs.

In my spare time knit, run long distances, spend time with my family, and
read any scary book I can get my hands on.

My core belief about managing is that a good manager may not make your life better, but a bad manager can certainly make it worse!
Life is hard already, let's not make it harder for each other.
