Hi! I'm Cole, a Senior Engineering Manager at Zendesk! I'm most comfortable at the core of the
business. I like to see my teams impact company strategy and make our customer's lives better.

I spent almost a decade as a hands on engineer at a few different companies until I started managing in 2017. I kept my hands on the keyboard until
my teams grew too big for me to responsible be in their critical path as a coder (and maybe a little past that point... oops!).

I get really nerdy about leadership and engineering management and read about it broadly. I have a 3 year masters in Transformative Leadership and
Social Change from the Maryland University of Integrative Health and have taken part in several executive and leadership coaching programs.

My core belief about managing is that a good manager may not make your life better, but a bad manager can certainly make it worse!
Life is hard already, let's not make it harder for each other.

In my spare time I love to knit, run long distances, read any scary book I can get my hands on

A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme 
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](blog.base68.com).

You can **download** the theme here:

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
