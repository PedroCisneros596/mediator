Hello, this is my blog and personal portolio of anything that [I do](https://github.com/fr4nkR). 
I am a devops software engineer at H-E-B.

I am interested in the fields of automation and security.

Outside of work I like to listen to metal and rock, go out for a run, and collect lava lamps.

You can contact me at my email address: franc.rangel07@protonmail.com.
