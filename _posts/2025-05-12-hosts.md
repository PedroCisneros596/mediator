Are you curious to know who is hosting you in their home? It is time to meet the hosts, the people that offer you their homes for some nights while they are away. 


Wait… If it is someone’s home why is it so empty? Here we will discover if the people hosting you are really just normal people like you and I that want to earn some extra money while their away or if it is a company with over 50 apartments in the city. 


We can classify hosts in two categories: individual and commercial. The former are individual people renting their own home while they are not using it and the latter are professional hosts or companies with several apartments in the city. 


Firstly, we will look at the number of hosts depending on host type in every city.

![Number of hosts depending on host type in every city](/assets/hosts/numhost_by_host_type.png)


In all cities except for Athens, most hosts are individual hosts. Moreover, in cities like London and Paris, the difference is astonishing. In Paris, the number of individual hosts is more than 4 times the number of commercial hosts. With this information, it could seem like the people who would benefit more from Airbnb are individual hosts, right?


Let’s try to dig a bit deeper by looking at the number of listings by host type in every city.

Now the story starts to look a bit different. Even though we just saw that the majority of listings are owned by individual hosts, now we see that in many cities like Barcelona, Madrid, Prague or Vienna most listings are controlled by commercial hosts. Furthermore, in cities like Paris and London where the difference between the number of commercial and individual hosts was astonishing, when it comes to the number of listings, the difference between the number of them that are controlled by individual and commercial hosts is less impressive here. 


To take a closer look at this, we have plotted the percentage of hosts that own 80% of the total listings in each city. In cities like Prague and Barcelona, there’s a big concentration of listings by a few hosts, given that there are 40% of hosts that own 80% of the listings. In other cities like Paris and especially Amsterdam the situation looks very different, and the percentages are around 80% of hosts owning 80% of the listings. A reason why Amsterdam does not have a big concentration of listings on the hands of only a few hosts could be because they were [pioneers]( https://nltimes.nl/2025/03/11/amsterdam-slashing-home-holiday-rentals-15-nights-per-year-two-popular-areas) in regulations against Airbnb and holiday rentals, establishing strict rules in 2014.

This makes us want to dig deeper into the profiles of people that have more than one apartment. To do this, we will analyze the percentage of hosts with more than one listing in each city.

Here we see that most hosts that have more than one listing have between 2 and 4 listings in all cities. Furthermore, we see that in cities like Prague and Barcelona, the percentage of hosts with between 5 and 9 listings is around 15-20%. In several cities there are also several cities with around 10% of hosts owning between 10 and 25 listings and in all cities except for Amsterdam you can also find multiple hosts with more than 26 listings. This makes it clear that this are not people trying to get some extra money on their home or their summer house, but professionals attracted by a very profitable business model.

To get a deeper understanding on the host profiles, we can also take a look at when they joined Airbnb. For this we have created an interactive time series plot showing the number of new Airbnb hosts per year by city.

For the case of Amsterdam, we see that the number of new hosts was growing steadily since 2008 and then it started going down after 2014. In [2014]( https://nltimes.nl/2025/03/11/amsterdam-slashing-home-holiday-rentals-15-nights-per-year-two-popular-areas), as mentioned earlier is when Amsterdam introduced its first significant rules for holiday rentals, including maximum rental periods and reporting requirements. Looking at the data for Paris and London, we see that there was a very steep increase in the number of new hosts until 2015 and then it went down quite steadily until 2020. Coincidentally, from 2017 onwards, enforcement and fines against violation on short-term rental regulations increased in Paris. According to [Le Parisien]( https://www.leparisien.fr/economie/airbnb-a-paris-les-amendes-infligees-aux-loueurs-de-meubles-touristiques-explosent-11-08-2017-7186869.php), in the first half of 2017, Parisians who rented out their properties to tourists for more than the legal maximum of 120 days-many via Airbnb-were collectively fined €615,000, a sharp increase from €45,000 during the same period in 2016. Moreover, all cities experienced an increase in the number of hosts after 2020. This aligns with data that shows that Airbnb and similar platforms [experienced]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Short-stay_accommodation_offered_via_online_collaborative_economy_platforms_-_impact_of_the_Covid-19_pandemic) significant growth after the Covid pandemic.
