So, for many months now I‚Äôve been extolling the virtues of the killer combo that is a Razer Blade paired with a Razer Core. I know of 3 colleagues I talked into the pair, plus many more whom I‚Äôve planted the seed in and may or may not have pulled the trigger without me knowing. It‚Äôs a great setup, especially if you want to move away from having ‚Äútoo many computers‚Äù and, like me, have a core gaming desktop as well as a day to day laptop.

In August, my MacBook Pro‚Äôs video card started to give out. It‚Äôs 4 years old, so it‚Äôs understandable and no hard feelings. After much research I decided to take my own advice and buy the recently released New Blade from Razer and pair it with a Core with a 1080 inside. About the start of September, I went to pull the trigger and that‚Äôs where the fun began. What follows is a timeline of the absolute comedy of errors that began that is *so* ridiculous I can‚Äôt even be mad‚Ä¶ and only just laugh at this story. It‚Äôs a long read, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a meticulously detailed timeline of events for maximum impact and reliability. I promise you it‚Äôs worth the read.

**Sept. 5th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì I finally decided to pull the trigger and to order a Core and Blade combo to replace my desktop and aging (and literally melting) MacBook Pro laptop all in one go. First tried to go online to the special Partner store, since as a employee of a game studio partnered with Razer, I am able to get a few minimal but none the less nice discounts. Unfortunately, the promotion they are running for $100 off a Core when purchasing a New Blade is not offered on the Partner store. Also, no New Blade‚Äôs are listed on the store either, only the legacy ones. (As I learned later there is a 3 month lag for new products on the partner store. Lame, but I can rationalize the reasoning on that to some degree and no major complaints). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I then went to the regular store url/login with my personal account. The promotional bundle was offered, but the New Blades were currently listed on back-order with no date for future availability. The only option is to sign up to be notified when on sale‚Ä¶ so I signed up and eagerly wait!</span>

**Sept. 21st**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ish) ‚Äì I receive an email stating the New Blades will once again be shipping in October, and are preorder-able on Oct 2nd at 9 am PST. I set an alarm to remind myself to hop on immediately at that time and preorder one, just in case.</span>

**Oct. 2**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì I hop out of bed bright and early in my hotel room at Twitchcon and ordered my New Blade and Core together at 9:02 AM just as it unlocked. The Core is listed to ship on Oct 14th, and Blade Pro is listed on back-order until Oct 28th. Remember this. üòâ</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While ordering, I found code online for a free $49 messenger bag if ordering a Blade. I put the code in, because I love free stuff! The order form accepted the code and confirmed the free bag. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 hours later, the order confirmation was emailed to me (seems kind of long? Was a bit worried something went wrong up until then due to demand or something.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also discover at this time that the $100 off discount was not applied. Apparently you don‚Äôt get it automatically? The discount appears to be emailed as a promo code as part of the order confirmation email, once your order has been processed and subsequently confirmed. Instructions state it must be applied separately to a different Core order to be claimed?!</span>

**Oct. 4th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì After chatting options with a friend at Razer for advice, I reached out to Support to find out how to get the $100 credit applied to my order. unfortunately, the s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">upport form is limited to 550 characters only. No email, no phone. Very hard to explain most problems in so few words but I managed it. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support form gave me an auto email to expect a reply in up to 1-2 business days, as to be expected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the same day, I received an unrelated email stating the following: </span>

> *<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThank you for ordering from the RazerStore. As indicated during checkout, one or more of the products you ordered is currently unavailable and cannot be shipped. You will receive an email notification when your order has been shipped.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated shipping period</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Razer Basic Messenger Bag: null‚Äù</span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking farther down email, there is an additional section: </span>

> *<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúnote:The item(s) in your order will only ship once </span>****all****<span style="font-weight: 400;"> item(s) are ready for shipment.‚Äù</span>*

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, does this mean that even if the core and blade are ready to ship, the whole order will be held for this mystery bag with a ‚Äúnull‚Äù ship date? In paranoia, I o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pen second support ticket, asking about this issue in detail.</span>

**Oct. 5th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì Support has replied to my first ticket. They explained that they are unable to apply the promotional credit, and that if I want to get the $100 off of my Core, I must cancel my order and start over by ordering the blade first, wait for the confirmation email with code, then use that code to order a core separately. </span>

> *<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúHi, J.</span>*

Later that day, the other ticket is replied to saying that they cannot confirm for sure if the order status of the messenger bag would hold up the rest of the order or not. I‚Äôm told that it should not have actually been made available and is indefinitely out of stock and no longer officially offered as a promotion. Additionally, they are unable to make any changes or adjustments to my orders promotional codes and that if I wanted to cancel the order and start over they were happy to do so.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded to the first email confirming that yes, I would like to cancel the order and start over, in that case. (Especially in light of all the above nonsense). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They respond they have ‚Äúrequested‚Äù a cancellation, and stressed this is not actually confirmation it has been canceled. Was told I need to wait for a cancellation confirmation email before it‚Äôs \*actually\* canceled. The confirmation eventually came about two days later. Why on earth does that need to happen or take so long? Who knows. I then t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ried to make two new orders. First I ordered the New Blade, in HD (not the QHD+) with a 1TB HD. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order form rejected my billing address confirmation, telling me I needed to enter a ‚Äúvalid value‚Äù for State and country, highlighting them in red. Note: These are pre-filled drop downs, not text. I simply picked the options that applied (CA, US). It kept rejecting them over and over again, until I hard-refreshed the page, wiping out the form entirely and starting over.</span>

![screenshot-2016-10-05-12-53-11](/assets/article_images/imported/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-10-05-12.53.11.png)

**Oct. 6th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì Still no order confirmation the following morning. Without it, I can‚Äôt order the Core, and I‚Äôm also becoming worried that I may slip back into a further batch of Blades. On a whim, I decided to check my order history, out of idle curiosity. It actually showed duplicate entries for every order! There were 12 line items for 3 simply orders, each repeated 4 times. This is really weird and confusing, and obviously a bug of some kind. Also still showed my recent order as ‚ÄúIn Process‚Äù a whole day later.</span>

![screenshot-2016-10-05-15-41-38](/assets/article_images/imported/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-10-05-15.41.38-1024x521.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that day, roughly 26 hours after the initial order, I finally get my order confirmation with a discount code for the core. (Irony‚Ä¶ the discount code looks to be the SAME as the one from the first ever order.. It‚Äôs apparently not a unique code? Either that or it‚Äôs keyed to my email or something and the same for just me. Had I known that, I wouldn‚Äôt have waited!) I order a Core it using this code, getting my nice $100 discount. Again however, I experience the *EXACT SAME* bug with the state/country drop down! I hard refresh once more, and this fixes it. I think it‚Äôs possibly related to chrome‚Äôs automatic filling of known address info at this point. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, it‚Äôs important to note for reasons below that the Razer Core still has a shipping date of October 14th and the New Blade is Oct 28th. Sounds good to me!</span>

**Oct. 15th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì Still no shipping confirmation for my Core, which was due out the day before. I begin checking the order status page daily because I am an impatient nerd who wants his shiny toys! The store site still says it‚Äôs shipping Oct. 14th when I checked on the 15th, and 16th, and I believe I looked again on the 17th (my notes are fuzzy there). My order confirmation also says the 14th still, I checked to make sure I wasn‚Äôt crazy.</span>

**Oct. 18th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì I check the order status, still no updates! However, the Core listing in the Store \*now\* says ‚Äúback ordered, ships from 10/28‚Äù. I w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as given zero emails or heads up about this new delay however. A s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ilent stealth update to the site? Not great customer service experience. Totally understanding things happen, but an email/update would really have been nice.</span>

**Oct. 19**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì A New Blade Pro has just been announced. *Shit.* Do I still want a New Blade, or do I want the Pro? Is a pro better for my needs? Does the Pro even need a Core with it‚Äôs sexy new gpu? It the Pro too big in size for my needs though? I almost have buyers remorse before I even have the product. I don‚Äôt know what to do. The New blade doesn‚Äôt ship for another week. Also I now know details about the rumored MacBook Pro refresh coming next week. It might be a better solution and at this rate will arrive sooner .Maybe it‚Äôs better to cancel and wait and see how reviews pan out? I reach out to cancel my Blade order (even though it risks missing out on another back-order window) to wait and see the right options for me, since this is no small investment. Definitely lots of sudden decision making to be made.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am told by support that because I used the discount code for the Core, I have to cancel the Core order also. Fair enough, that makes total sense to me, so I cancel both orders. I am a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gain told the order cancellation has been requested, but not confirmed, until I receive such an email.</span>

**Oct. 20th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì The email confirmation that my Blade order was successfully canceled arrives. (but I failed to notice there was not one about my core).</span>

**Oct. 24th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì 4 emails came in at the exact same time together (3:39AM) in one batch with identical time stamps.</span>

1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping confirmation of Core stating it has just gone out.</span>
2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Email stating they were unable to successfully cancel my core order (duh?).</span>
3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Email stating they have put in a request to issue a return order for my core as a courtesy due to my existing cancellation request. (Wow thanks!)</span>
4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Email confirming the cancellation request and accepting my return order, with return instructions and a mailing address. (With the implied instructions that I need to pay the cost of shipping myself to return it to the listed address in Hong Kong, to get the refund.)</span>

Then, at 9:30 am that same morning ***my core arrives at my office suddenly!***

Yeah. That happened.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I run the numbers on FedEx and UPS to estimate shipping costs to return the core for my refund. Retail costs for a one-off shipment of this size and weight come back at $300 and $250 respectively. Totally impractical to do in order to get a refund on a $400 order! Both return-related emails come from ‚Äúdo not email this address‚Äù accounts so following up on this hurdle is now difficult for me.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess I‚Äôll just sit on this Core for now‚Ä¶ I may still end up with a blade, and in THEORY it‚Äôs supposed to work with any USB C laptop, including that plan B mac.</span>

**Oct. 27th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì After reading initial reviews on the Pro, it seems it really isn‚Äôt the laptop for me. Additionally I am not satisfied with the details on the new MacBook Pro so I went ahead and placed a fresh order for the New Blade, in the HD 1TB model. Since I‚Äôm stuck with this Core that I can‚Äôt really return easily, I figured why not. I placed the order, and as expected, I was told it is still on back-order, due to ship on October 28th (the next day) as before.</span>

**Oct. 29th**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‚Äì Checking to see if my Blade has shipped yet, I now see that the QHD+ model is currently shipping as of the day before, as is expected, but that the HD model that I had ordered now reads </span>**‚ÄúAvailable for Pre-order. Ships from 11th November, 2016.**<span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äù It would appear it has slipped 2 weeks‚Ä¶ sadly for me this is the day after I leave for Japan for a week so it leaves me without the laptop for my travels. üôÅ</span>

**Nov. 2nd** ‚Äì On a whim, I‚Äôm not sure why, I felt the urge to check the pre-order status of the laptop again. It now reads the following: **‚ÄúAvailable for Pre-order. Ships from 28th November, 2016.‚Äù** Well, guess we had ourselves yet another stealth slip it would seem‚Ä¶ \*sigh\*

![screenshot-2016-11-03-16-41-09](/assets/article_images/imported/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-03-16.41.09.png)

Well, at least you guys emailed me this time I guess‚Ä¶ Though 2 days late. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I then went to the store to look up the listing for shits and giggles. The order page for the 1TB HD Blade no longer has a ‚Äúpreorder/shipping 28th‚Äù status. The purchase button has now been replaced with a ‚Äúnotify me‚Äù button, and the release date has been replaced with ‚ÄúRegister your interest‚Äù.</span>

![screenshot-2016-11-04-12-32-34](/assets/article_images/imported/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-04-12.32.34-1024x727.png)

Oooookaaaaay. Let‚Äôs just say at this point I have ***zero fucking confidence*** that this thing is actually shipping Nov 28th.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After sharing this story around with some friends, I learn from one of them they had a very similar experience and ended up buying theirs on Amazon.com. Wait what?! I look and lo and behold Amazon has them currently in stock!! I just ordered it there, right now, with overnight shipping for an additional $9, and requested to cancel the previous order via the Razer store once and for all.</span>

![screenshot-2016-11-04-13-02-33](/assets/article_images/imported/2016/11/Screenshot-2016-11-04-13.02.33-1024x545.png)

JEEZE!!!

Any one of these things, or even two, is likely a minor annoyance, but the combined force of this ridiculousness is beyond ludicrous. C‚Äômon Razer üôÅ Just ditch Digital River as your store vendor already and do this in house. I know you could do so better at this if you just put a vested ownership into the experience!

**EDIT- 11/6/16:**  Just got the shipping confirmation from Amazon.com! The laptop HAS shipped. a Razer Blade DOES physically exist with my name on it and is en-route! It was set for next day delivery, and due to ship out Monday, so there is even a chance it may arrive tomorrow!

**EDIT 2 ‚Äì 11/7/16:** So everything wasn‚Äôt \*quite\* as sunshine and rainbows as the last update seemed. [For the next stage in the saga, check out part two of this adventure!](http://sargonas.com/razer-blade-woes-round-2-the-amazoning/)
