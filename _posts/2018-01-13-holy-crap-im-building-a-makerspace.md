<span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay… to step back a bit, it’s not QUITE that complex. I’m building a private, small (size and scale) maker space. It’s going to be a bit of an ongoing experiment to lay the groundwork for \*actually\* building a large scale, public space in a better location down the road and hopefully making it open to public membership.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just secured a current location in Santa Monica in a great area that’s close to the expo line and down town SM. It’s only about 350 sq feet, but its bigger than you’d think and more importantly, the lease is exceptionally well priced for our needs, includes power and internet in the cost, and has its own entrance/exit with 24/7 access that I can apply some smart automation to.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re going to start off small… I and a few Rioters are going to be moving some 3D Printers, tools, accessories and other related stuff there. Though, no major power tools, no CNCs, nothing that would disrupt the 9-5 lives of our fellow tenants in their tech offices out of both politeness and necessity. My hope is that my fellow Rioters and friends can make good use of a shared creative space for 3D Printing, Cosplay making, prop fabrication, circuitry noodling and other stuff in a relatively small but shareable space via evening creative sessions and fun group weekend collaborations. I’m not going to ask for a specific fixed dollar amount from folks in order to partake in the space to fully offset the cost, but hopefully people will contribute enough in their own way that I’m not fully out of pocket entirely, and it can be self sustaining.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a month to month lease so we can experiment as long as its working for us, and either sunset things if they don’t or use it as a springboard to securing a bigger, more appropriate long term space and turning it into a public venture. Additionally the monthly cost is reasonable enough that I am comfortable shouldering it myself as part of the experiment, worst case.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no idea what I’m doing and this is probably a stupid idea I’ll regret down the road, but I’m incredibly excited and highly motivated right now!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a related note, if anyone is interested in investing into an \*actual\* Makerspace on the Westside of LA with me, that changes things greatly and offsets the challenge of bootstrapping an idea from scratch. Let’s talk.. You know how to find me.!</span>
