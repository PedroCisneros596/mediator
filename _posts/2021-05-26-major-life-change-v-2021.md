In late June Iâ€™ll be leaving Genvid. I have something amazing lined up starting on the 21st that I just couldnâ€™t say no to, which Iâ€™ll elaborate later on at that time. For now all Iâ€™ll say is that I am, \*GASP!\* LEAVING THE GAMES INDUSTRY after 16 years. However, I am still very much entrenched in tech, taking on a VP role in FinTech doing something that unexpectedly stokes my passions in an entirely different direction.

When I left Riot Games for this opportunity at Genvid in 2018 it was for all the right reasons, and Iâ€™m so grateful for my time there as a result. It gave me \*exactly\* what I was looking for: an opportunity to learn, grow, be challenged in new ways. To try new things, and absolutely revolutionize what interactive entertainment looks like, and set the table for the upcoming conversations weâ€™ll all be having about the Metaverse.

I think I helped them head towards that goal in many ways, and Iâ€™ll be 100% genuine when I say that submitting my resignation was tied with doing so at Riot as the hardest I have ever done. I agonized over it, because I really DO feel like they are changing the world, and I didnâ€™t want any one to wrongly think I had lost faith in that vision, or that the ground they are breaking was no longer worth my time.

None of that is true, Iâ€™m just ready for a wild and crazy 180 degrees into an entirely different direction while I still have some of the few remaining better years left in me to take these crazy risks.Genvid is going to become a household name in entertainment, not just gaming, and the next 3 years are going to blow your mind. Honestly.. you should go work for them on this stuff.. let me know if you need a referral, I know a guy. ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tf6/2/16/1f609.png)
