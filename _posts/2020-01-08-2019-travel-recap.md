Hot off the heels of an exciting dive into a [whole new level of travel activity in 2018](http://sargonas.com/2018-travel-recap/), 2019 started off even busier!   
  
While 2018 was a busy one at nearly 60 flights covering 80,000 miles, and 3 trips to Japanâ€¦ 2019 saw me top that all time record with close to 70 flights, and 97,000 actual-miles (though I earned a whopping 140k qualification miles with Delta towards my Medallion status, and even more than that in redeemable miles!)

![](/assets/article_images/imported/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-16.06.03-1024x947.png)Hereâ€™s some of the notable numbers for folks who like stats:

- 70 flights (around 60 Work related)
- 97k Miles
- 10 days and 11 hours in a planeâ€¦ or 251 hours total!
- 20 different airports/cities
- 5 countries (America, Canada, Japan, South Korea, and The U.K.)
- 25 different aircraft typesâ€¦ (which, when you reduce variants down to base-models and ignore some obscure regional planes, it covers just about every plane in domestic commercial aviation!)

![](/assets/article_images/imported/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-16.06.14-1024x757.png)![](/assets/article_images/imported/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-08-16.06.07-1024x979.png)There was a bit of a summer gap, so ultimately the travel was not that much higher than 2018 as I originally imagined, but it was still quite a lot, and there were some REAL gauntlets in there at times. (Iâ€™m looking at you, mid October to December 6th, where I only spent 8 days at home!)  
  
Most importantly though, this crazy year pushed me above the ever important 125,000 mile threshold with Delta which means I got the most important email of all on December 31st when I flew back to LA from Japan:

![](/assets/article_images/imported/2020/01/Annotation-2020-01-08-161915-1024x683.png)Not gonna lieâ€¦ feels good. ðŸ˜‰  
  
That said, it WAS exhausting. I got a lot of people commenting on my travel posts about how envious they were of my travel and ability to do soâ€¦ but the reality is, itâ€™s not all fun. I love my job, I love the opportunities and experience all that travel opens up, but at the end of the day I *am* an introvert, and sometimes just want to sit in my own home in sweat pants playing video games and reading and 3D printing and pretending the outside world doesnâ€™t exist.. and the longer I go without doing that the more stressed I feel, no matter how exciting the experience are. Stillâ€¦ itâ€™s an exciting time to be me.
