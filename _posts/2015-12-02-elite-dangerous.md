[  ](/assets/article_images/imported/2015/12/Screenshot_0018.png)Well, back down the rabbit hole we go! Last year around this time I got pretty hard into Elite: Dangerous, but around March due to work and other things I sorta fell out a bit.. and as most of you know once you get too far out of a game it’s hard to get back in.

Flash forward to now, and they’ve announced a new expansion, Horizons, which allows you to LAND ON FREAKING PLANETS! Between this, and the pending launch of the retail version of an Oculus (which I dabbled with the DK2 with in Elite, HOLY CRAP!) I figured it was time to get back in.

I dusted off my X-55 H.O.T.A.S (literally), patched up, and got back into the awesome. I tend to prefer to spend most of my time exploring deep space (and soon making the 28Kylie trip to Sagittarius A\*) and have also contemplated joining up with the [Fuel Rats](http://fuelrats.org) potentially as well. If anyone wants to follow along, I’ve got a CMDR’s log going over at [Inara.cz](http://inara.cz/cmdr/11104) where you can see some of my travel logs, my personal fleet, and some major accomplishments [like my first trip ever to a Black Hole system.](http://inara.cz/cmdr-logbook/11104/3938)
