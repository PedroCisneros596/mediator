Airbnbs in major European cities receive consistently high scores across multiple categories,
including cleanliness, communication, location, and overall rating. Our analysis reveals that
most cities maintain high average scores, with slight variations.

But are these high scores consistent across all areas? Or are there neighborhoods where
even the best Airbnbs struggle to maintain satisfaction?

**Exploring the Best and Worst Neighborhoods**
While most Airbnbs maintain high ratings, the quality of a stay often depends on the
neighborhood. We explored the best and worst Airbnbs in five major European cities —
Madrid, Vienna, Prague, London, and Amsterdam — and discovered a clear pattern.

- In [Madrid](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187514-i126-k5658697-Solo_traveller_to_Madrid_any_tips_for_safe_accommodation-Madrid.html), the best Airbnbs are in quiet local areas like San Diego and Opañel, while
Justicia, known for nightlife, suffers from noise complaints.
- [Vienna](https://viennawurstelstand.com/article/15-4-reasons-to-love-the-15th-district-viennas-most-exciting-dirty-little-secret/) shines in Favoriten and Leopoldstadt, but Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus struggles with redevelopment issues.
- [London](https://www.plumguide.com/journal/safest-area-in-london-to-stay-for-a-first-visit) offers top stays in Notting Hill and Shoreditch, but areas like Croydon and Brixton are known for higher crime and lower ratings. 
- In [Amsterdam](https://amsterdamwonderland.com/where-to-stay-in-amsterdam-a-neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood-airbnb-guide/), the Jordaan and De Pijp provide charming, top-rated stays, but the crowded Red Light District is a frequent disappointment.

**So, Are Travelers Happy?**
Overall, most travelers are happy with their Airbnb stays in these cities, with average review
scores remaining consistently high. But the neighborhood matters. The best experiences are
often found in quieter, authentic areas away from the main tourist hubs, while the worst are
typically in crowded, noisy districts.
