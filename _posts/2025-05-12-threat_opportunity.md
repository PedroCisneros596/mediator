Airbnb listings are not evenly spread across cities—they tend to cluster in popular, central
neighborhoods. Our interactive heatmap shows that the highest density of Airbnb properties
is found in the heart of each city, from the historic streets of Paris and Barcelona to the
vibrant centers of Athens and Amsterdam. In some neighborhoods, Airbnb is more than just
a tourism boost—it's a disruptive force.

Rising rents, displacement of locals, and a shift from residential housing to tourist
accommodations are the reality in these areas:

**Athens:**
- Kolonaki, Koukaki, Pangrati, and Exarchia are the neighborhoods most affected.
Local residents, including students in Exarchia and families in Pangrati, are
struggling to find affordable housing as landlords prioritize short-term rentals.
- The Greek government has responded by limiting short-term rentals in these districts
to protect local communities, as [reported](
https://www.barrons.com/news/short-term-rental-limits-in-popular-athens-areas-takeeffect-ce810cde) by Barron's. 
- The overall number of short-term rental accommodations in Athens saw a 24.56%
increase from February 2023 to September 2024, as [reported](https://news.gtp.gr/2024/10/11/short-term-rental-accommodations-rise-in-downtown-athens/) by Gree Travel Pages.

**Barcelona:**
- The Gothic Quarter and Eixample have become hotspots for tourists but a nightmare
for residents. In the Gothic Quarter, the local population has dropped by almost half
as properties are converted into short-term rentals.
- The Gothic Quarter has lost 45% of its local population, replaced by tourist
accommodations, as [reported](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/29/the-airbnb-invasion-of-barcelona) by The New Yorker. 
- In response, Barcelona is planning to ban short-term tourist rentals by 2028, as [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/barcelona-mayor-defends-ban-touris
t-flats-drastic-action-needed-cut-housing-costs) by The Guardian.
