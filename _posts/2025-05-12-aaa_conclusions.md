By analyzing the Airbnb market of eight major European cities, we have discovered diverse impacts from Airbnb, shaped by local tourism trends, housing markets, and policy responses. 

Cities like Athens and Prague attract budget-conscious travelers that sometimes travel in groups, illustrating how Airbnb can influence the type of tourism a city receives. This insight is valuable for policymakers aiming to shape tourism in ways that align with local priorities and community needs.

In contrast, Amsterdam stands out for its relatively low number of listings catering to higher-spending visitors and for experiencing less pronounced seasonality compared to other major European destinations. Notably, Amsterdam has been a pioneer in implementing strict short-term rental regulations. These measures aim to balance tourism benefits with neighborhood stability and have become a model for other cities facing similar challenges.

Our review of user feedback shows that, overall, guests are satisfied with their Airbnb experiences. However, in cities like London, listings in districts known for safety concerns tend to receive lower ratings, underscoring the importance of location and local context in guest satisfaction.

We also observed that in some areas-particularly Athens and Barcelona-Airbnb has become so dominant that it has contributed to severe housing shortages for residents, prompting local governments to introduce strict regulations or outright bans on certain types of short-term rentals. These policy interventions are designed to protect affordable housing and maintain the livability of urban neighborhoods.

Besides, we have detected seasonality patterns in different cities and we have seen that big music concerts (by performer like Taylor Swift or Beyonc√©) and festivals like Pride in Madrid can cause significant spikes in occupancy rates. On the other hand, it seems like tourists tried to avoid Paris while it was hosting the Olympics.

All in all, we believe that the only in which Airbnbs and local communities can live in harmony is by strict regulations like in Amsterdam that can reduce the number of listings and focus on conscious tourism that can be thoughtful and respectful of locals and their lifestyles.
