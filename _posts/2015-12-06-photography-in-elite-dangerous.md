I’ve come to find out, with some tweaks, you can take some stellar photos in ED. (Pun not intended!!)

Was poking around last night and found a gorgeous blue star. Rukbat A to be precise. Popping to the outside camera, and taking a high def screenshot (which you can only do in Solo mode, mind you) resulted in something pretty awesome. I’m going to have to start doing this more often!

Do be careful if you go poking around this system to see it for yourself however! Rukbat C is an equally impressive greenish-white star, but while on the way to it you might get unexpectedly yanked from supercruise without warning for getting too close to it’s binary partner Rukbat B, a Neutron Star. It never looks bigger than the background stars but it’s there, and Neutrons are serious business with a massive sphere of influence on your ship!

Here it is again on imgur in about 4x the resolution, for those who care: <http://imgur.com/gallery/nS0jBKR>
