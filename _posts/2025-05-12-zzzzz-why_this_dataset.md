Are you ready to embark on a journey through the busy streets and hidden corners of
Europe? We certainly are! Our team of enthusiastic explorers has set out on an exciting
mission — to uncover the hidden stories behind Airbnb in some of Europe’s most famous
cities.
But why Airbnb, you might ask? Because in the heart of every great city, there is a constant
push and pull between tourists seeking adventure and locals trying to preserve their way of
life. Airbnb is at the center of this conflict, acting as both a gateway for travelers and a
potential disruptor for local communities.
We chose eight of Europe’s most popular destinations: **Amsterdam**, **Athens**, **Barcelona**,
**Madrid**, **Prague**, **Vienna**, **London**, and **Paris**. These are cities where the charm of history
meets the modern life. They are cities that draw millions of tourists every year — but they
are also home to millions of people who live, work, and dream there.
We start our exploration with an interactive map that gives you a sense of the scale and
impact of Airbnb in these cities. Each city is marked with a pin showing:
- The number of tourists who visited the city (June 2024 - June 2025).
- The total revenue generated by Airbnb in each city. (based on statistical sources and
bank sources)

This map reveals the significant differences in tourist numbers and Airbnb earnings across
the cities. London and Paris not only have the highest earnings but also receive the most
tourists, highlighting their status as global destinations.
Next, we look at the number of Airbnb listings in each city. This gives us a clear picture of the
size of the Airbnb market in each location.

Paris and London lead the pack with the highest number of Airbnb listings. These global
tourist hubs show how Airbnb has become a popular choice for accommodation. Even
smaller cities like Prague and Vienna have a substantial number of listings.
Finally, we explore the economic impact of Airbnb in each city — specifically, how much
money is generated through these short-term rentals.

Despite having a similar number of listings, London and Paris generate far more revenue
from Airbnb compared to other cities. This suggests that properties in these cities may
command higher prices or have higher occupancy rates.
